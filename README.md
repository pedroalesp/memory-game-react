# Frontend Developer - Memory game.

This repository contains the implementation of the solution to the _"Frontend developer challenge for Modyo"_. The solution incorporates all the requested features and some others added by the developer (me ðŸ‘‹).

A demo of the solution can be accessed [here](https://modyomemorygame.netlify.app/).

## Overview

The implemented solution has been built using _React + Vite_. All files are located in the **src** folder and the project was deloyed on Netlify.

## Solution architecture

The chosen methodology was atomic design, in order to make the components reusable as much as possible and to make it easier to scale the app.

The solution is based on a main component (Layout) that handles most of the app's statuses and renders the gameboard (Board component) and the Score component.

Additionally, a Modal component has been included. Its features are to manage the user's name and the number of pairs of cards to be played with, also to congratulate the player once the game is completed and restard the gameboard.
